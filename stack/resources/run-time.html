<h3>Abstract Data Types</h3>

In this lecture we will present two different implementations for an
important data type <b>stack</b>. 

<p>
The goal of the lecture is to show a systematic design and
implementation of a user defined data structure in the <em>programming
language C</em>. Moreover, we will briefly look at the efficiency of
our implementations introducing the technique of <em>amortized</em>
analysis.


<p>
Stack are used in many places in computer science
<ul>
<li> algorithms (dfs search, etc.)  
<li> compilers (parsing context free languages) 
<li> programming languages (keeping track of procedure calls)
<li> operating systems (least recently used page replacement algorithm
for virtual memory)
</ul>

<p>
We will describe a stack as an <b>abstract data type</b>, just by
defining the <em>data</em> we want to store in our data type and the
<em>operations</em> we want to perform on the data structure.

<h3>Header Files</h3>
<p>
We can define the "interface" to our data type in a <em>header</em>
file. The actual implementation is unimportant for the usage of stacks,
and is consequently hidden from the user. 
Also, as long as we keep the "interface" the same we can change the
implementation of our data structure, without changing user
programs which are using that data structure.

<h4>File: stack.h</h4>
<pre>
#ifndef __STACK_H_
#define __STACK_H_

/* 
 *  A stack is a ``first-in last-out'' data structure.
 *  In this file, we define the operations we want to
 *  apply to our ``abstract data structure''. All the
 *  implementation details are hidden from the user.
 */



void push(int x);
/* push new element on top of the stack */

void stackinit();
/* initializes the stack */

int pop();
/* pops element from the top of the stack and returns it */

int top();
/* returns element on top of the stack */

int stacksize();
/* number of elements in the stack */

int isempty();
/* checks if stack is empty */

#endif
</pre>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> Which of the stack operations is not really necessary?

<h4>Test Program</h4>
<p>
Without worrying about the implementation of our data structure, we
can write some code which is using the data structure. Our test
program will push a series of numbers on the stack; afterwards, it
pops numbers from the stack and prints them until the stack is empty.

<p>
Now, that we have written the header file <tt>stack.h</tt> and the
test program <tt>test_stack.c</tt>, we can compile the test program
to have a quick syntax check:

<pre>
(slinky){biermann}[48]% gcc test_stack.c -c
</pre>

At this point, we can not create the executable, since we haven't
implemented the data structure, so we have to compile with option <tt>-c</tt>.

<h4>File: test_stack.c</h4>
<pre>
#include3 &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "stack.h"

int main() {
  int i;
  int x;

  stackinit();

  printf("push:\n");
  for (i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
    printf("%d\t",i);
    push(i);
  }
  
  printf("pop:\n");
  while (!isempty()) {
    x = pop();
    printf("%d\t",x);
  }
  printf("\n");
  
}
</pre>


<h3>Implementation 1</h3>
<p>
This implementation of a stack uses an array to store the elements,
and a variable for the index of the top of the stack. The code is
straight forward. However, we have to fix a maximum size for the stack
in advance since we can not change the size of an array at run time.

<p>
<b>Running Time</b><br>
The running time for each stack operation is constant. It doesn't matter
how many elements are in the stack, the time for pushing or popping elements
is always the same. We say that the time for each operation is <em>O(1)</em>.
In case you're not familiar with the O-notation, you should check it out in your
algorithms text book (e.g. Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest).


<h4>File: stack.c</h4>
<pre>
#include "stack.h"
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

/*  this implementation of a stack uses a array of fixed size to hold
 *  the elements pushed on the stack. The obvious shortcoming is we've
 *  to fix in advance how many elements to store.  
 */


#define MAX_STACK_SIZE 100

/* we represent a stack by an array, and a variable for the index of
 * the top of the stack (called ``stackpointer'' though not actually a
 * pointer variable) 
 */

int stackpointer;
int A[MAX_STACK_SIZE];

void stackinit() {
  stackpointer = 0;
  printf("initialized static stack.\n");
}

void push(int x) {
  
  if (stackpointer >= MAX_STACK_SIZE) {
    printf("stack overflow!");
    exit(0);
  }
  
  A[stackpointer++] = x;
}

int pop() {
  if (stackpointer <= 0) {
    printf("stack underflow!");
    exit(0);
  }
  return A[--stackpointer];
}

int top() {
  if (stackpointer <= 0) {
    printf("stack underflow!");
    exit(0);
  }
  return A[stackpointer-1];
}

int stacksize() {
  return stackpointer;
}

int isempty() {
  return (stackpointer == 0);
}
</pre>


<h3>Implementation 2</h3> 

In this implementation, we're using dynamic memory allocation to
grow and shrink our stack as we go along.

<p>
Our programming language C doesn't allow us to increase the size of an
array. We could work with pointers to allocate a continuous block of
memory; but again, we wouldn't be able to extend that block if we run
out of space (the space at the end of that block memory could be
already used for something else).

<p>Here's a simple strategy: Whenever we run out of space, we will
allocate a larger piece of memory for a new stack, copy everything to
the new stack, and release the memory for the old stack.

<p>In case we've only a few elements in our stack, we would like to shrink
the stack to use the memory more efficiently.

<p>Our concrete implementation does the following
<ul>
<li>
Whenever the stackpointer raises above <em>3/4 * n</em>, we will double the
size of the stack (<em>n</em> is the size of our stack).
<li>
Whenever the stackpointer drops below <em>1/4 * n</em>, we will reduce the
stack size to <em>n/2</em>.
</ul>

<p>
The intuition behind this algorithm is that resizing the stack takes
some time, but it doesn't happen too frequently. So on average, we'll
have only have a small running time. More precisely, we'll show that
the average running time for any sequence of update operations (push,
pop) is <em>O(1)</em>.

<p>
Assume that it takes time <em>n</em> to copy over <em>n</em> elements.
We at look at two consecutive resize operations. Imagine that we've
just resized our stack to contain <em>n</em> elements. Now, we perform
a sequence of update operations which is causing another resize.

<p>There are four possible cases:
<ol>
<li> increase to <em>n</em>, increase to <em>2n </em>
<li> increase to <em>n</em>, decrease to <em>n/2</em>
<li> decrease to <em>n</em>, increase to <em>2n </em>
<li> decrease to <em>n</em>, decrease to <em>n/2</em>
</ol>

We'll find lower bounds on the number of stack operations between the two 
resize operations. This way, we can bound the average running time of a
sequence of operations.

<p><bf>Cases:</bf>
<ol>
<li> Since the stacksize was increased initially, there were 
     <em>(3/4)*(n/2) = (3/8)*n</em> elements in the
     stack. During our sequence of operations, we added at least 
     <em>3/8n</em> elements to the stack to cause another resize.

<li> As above, there are initially <em>3/8n</em> elements in the
     stack. In order to cause a resize, we have to pop
     <em>1/8n</em> elements. (<em>3/8n - 1/8n = 1/4n</em>)

<li> The stacksize was decreased initially, so there are 
     <em>(1/4)*(2n) = n/2</em> elements in the stack. During
     our sequence of operations, we added <em>n/4</em> elements
     to cause the increase.

<li> As above, there are initially <em>n/2</em> elements in the
     stack. We have to remove at least <em>n/4</em> elements to
     cause a further decrease in the stack size.
     
</ol>

<p>
The case study above shows that starting with a stack of size <em>n</em>,
we've to perform at least <em>n/8</em> operations to trigger a resize 
operation which takes time of at most <em>n</em>.

<p>
We can amortize the time needed for the resize operation over the 
sequence of update operations:<br>


<em>t_average = (sum(t_i) + n)/m</em>, where <em>t_i </em> time of the <em>i </em>th 
                                       update operation, <em>m </em> number of operations

<p>
We assume that the time for a update operation to be constant, if the operations
doesn't involve any stack resizing. Thus,<br>

<em>t_average = O(1) + n/m < O(1) + n/(n/8) = O(1) + 8 = O(1)</em>

<p>
In other words, for any sequence of <em>m</em> stack operations, the
average running time for each operation is constant. Even though, some operations might
take longer than the others, on average this implementation is as fast as the naive
stack implementation! (at least, up to a constant factor).

<h3>Compiling and Using the Implementation</h3>

We compile the implementation using the <tt>-c</tt> option:

<pre>
(slinky){biermann}[50]% gcc stack.c -c
(slinky){biermann}[51]% gcc betterstack.c -c
</pre>

In order to create an executable for our test program, we 
 have to link it with the stack implementation.
The following calls to gcc creates the executables <tt>test_stack</tt> 
and <tt>test_better</tt>. 

<pre>
(slinky){biermann}[52]% gcc test_stack.o stack.o -o test_stack
(slinky){biermann}[53]% gcc test_stack.o betterstack.o -o test_better
</pre>



<h3>Problems:</h3>
<ul>

<li> The implementation better_stack is potentially wasteful. In order to
store <em>n</em> elements in the stack, how much memory is allocated at
most?
<p>

<li> The analysis above is very generous. Can you find tighter bounds by
     calculating the running time for separate cases more precisely?

<p>
<li> Consider the following algorithm:<br>
If you are running out of space, allocate memory for <em>n + k</em>
stack elements, where <em>n</em> is the current size of your stack and
<em>k</em> some constant; copy over the data from your old stack,
release the memory for the old stack, and use the newly allocated
memory as stack.
<p>
Starting with an empty stack, what's the running time for a sequence
of <em>m</em> push operations?
<p>

<li> 
In this problem, we've the following stack update rules:
<ul>
<li> double the stack size whenever you run out of space
  (allocate twice as much memory, copy over the data and release the old
  memory).
<li>If the stackpointer drops below <em>n/2</em> where <em>n</em> is the
   current size of the stack, we reduce the stack size to <em>n/2</em>.
  (allocate half as much memory, copy over the data and release the old
  memory).
</ul>
Why is this algorithm potentially bad? Can you find a sequence of operations
where every operation takes a lot of time? (Hint: come up with a situation where
you need to adapt the size of the stack after each operation.)
<p>

<li>
In my implementation, I chose <em>1/4</em> and <em>3/4</em> as thresholds
when to increase or shrink the size of the stack. Can you come up with other
such constants and a factor by how much you want to change the size of the stack?
How would this effect running time and memory usage?
<p>

<li>
Can you think of entirely different implementations of stack - which perform each
update operation in constant time?

<li>
Imagine a user program needs to have more than just one stack. How do you have to
change the code above (header and implementation) to be able to create and operate on
any number of stacks?
</ul>
