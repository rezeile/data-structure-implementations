# Data Structure Implementations

## Description

This directory contains implementations of commonly known data structures in 
c++. Each data structure is located in its own sub-directory (ex. stack/).
Within each directory there is a ".h" file which implements a c++ templeted 
generic container. For example, within the stack.h file, the entire class 
definition and implementation can be found. 

Furthermore, there is also an associated [data-structure]test.cpp file, which 
performs basic tests on the data structure. For example, within the stack/ 
folder, there is a stacktest.cpp file, which performs a test on the various operations 
of a stack (namely, its push, pop, isEmpty, and size operations.)
